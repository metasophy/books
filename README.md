Programming for dummies :)

Just need to learn 2 aspects ... 

Fundamental:

1. Problem Solving:
   Just solve the problem..using pen or on board ..whaterver..without thinking about any programming language..
   
2. Use a Programming Language(java,c#,kotlin..anything) to convert your solution to executable code..

Essential:

1. A programming language paradim (OOPS, PROCEDURAL,FUNCTIONAL )
2. Start Learning Design principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, DIE , SLAP etc..)
3. Start Learning Design patterns..
4. Subscribe to good blogs to keep yourself updated...
5. continue reading good books(like pragmatic book shelf...).

etc..


And we will be applying the essential principles to the solutions we provide..the more matured we are with them ..the better we become at programming..

How long it will take to learn or good at 1 & 2 : http://norvig.com/21-days.html...

So the point is ..i have not seen anybody good at this here :)..

So read a lot..to ensure you can bluff enough..for your survival.. :)
